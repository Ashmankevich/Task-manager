# Task-manager
The application that helps manage tasks.
To organize tasks, a board with cards is used, which are distributed by type: backlog, im progress, review or done.
Users can create cards, fill in the description and edit the text, change the position of the block in the list, move it through the lists (using the Drag N Drop), and also permanently delete a card or all done-cards. Also in the card, you can assign a user to participants in each task, set a priority of completion.
There is a convenient card filter by various parameters, as well as a task search.
For the convenience of the user, you can change the color theme(from dark to light).
